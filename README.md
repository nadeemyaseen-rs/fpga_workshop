Day 1 lecture 1.1:
An FPGA is a Field Programmabe Gate Array. It's main advantage over ASIC (Application specific integrated circuit) is that it's hardware can be re-configured as many time as we want as compared to ASIC in which the hardware once defined become permanet and can't be re-configured without repeating the entite cycle. An FPGA architecture has CLB
